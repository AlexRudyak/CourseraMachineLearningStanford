# Coursera - Machine Learning - Stanford Course

After losing all my answers to a sudden malfunction of my computer,
I've decided to upload all my Answers to GitHub.

>**I highly recommend taking the course, found at this link:**<br>
>**https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning**<br>
>**Probobly the best course in the world for machine learning.**

This repository is ment for my own Reference,
Since I wasn't blessed with perfect memory.

If it happens to help someone else, so be it.

I focus on vectorized solutions because loops are meh.

Enjoy.
